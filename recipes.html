                    <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>

                <h3>Peanut Butter Topping:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup of creamy peanut butter</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup of powdered sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of softened unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>Just a pinch of salt</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Directions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving some paper hanging over the sides for easy removal later.</li>
                    <li>In a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler, melt 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2 sticks of butter together until they’re smooth. Let it cool for a bit.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar, 4 large eggs, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract until it’s all mixed up nicely.</li>
                    <li>Slowly pour that smooth chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, stirring until everything is well combined.</li>
                    <li>In another bowl, sift together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Gradually add these dry ingredients to your wet mixture, stirring until they’re just combined. Don’t overdo it!</li>
                    <li>Pour this delightful brownie batter into your prepared baking pan, spreading it out evenly.</li>
                    <li>Now, in a separate bowl, mix together 1 cup of creamy peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 cup of softened butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and just a pinch of salt until it’s super smooth.</li>
                    <li>Drop spoonfuls of this peanut butter goodness onto your brownie batter.</li>
                    <li>Take a knife or a toothpick and swirl that peanut butter into the brownie batter to make beautiful swirls.</li>
                    <li>Pop the pan into your preheated oven and bake for around 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs (not wet batter). Keep an eye on it as baking times can vary.</li>
                    <li>Let those amazing brownies cool in the pan for about 20 minutes, then use the parchment paper to lift them out onto a cooling rack.</li>
                    <li>Once they’re completely cool, cut them into squares and indulge in your homemade, rich semi-sweet chocolate brownies with that heavenly creamy peanut butter swirl on top!</li>
